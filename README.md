This is a quick, messy, and thrown-together utility to automate
our chess-ladder for the Normandale Chess Club.

There is no documentation yet, and its just one file.
I hope you don't need to be reading this for any reason ever.


### Todo

* any documentation. Seriously.
* organize the code, in general
* input validation
* process draws appropriately
* keep track of the last-played date for each player
* ~~option to strip zero-win players from output~~ unnecessary
